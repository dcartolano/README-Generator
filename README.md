# README Generator

## Description

This app allows the user to generate a quality README.md file by following prompts and providing information in the terminal.

I built this project to get practice creating and writing to files, implementing node usage (specifically inquirer), and other basic web development concepts.

## Installation

Copy the SSH Key from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dcartolano/README-Generator.git) and perform a git clone into the directory of your choice. Open in VS Code or similar program. In the terminal, run "git i" to download all relevant node modules.

## Usage

To use, right click on the package.json file and select "Open in Integrated Terminal" (if using VS Code). Follow the prompts and enter or select the information as requested.
